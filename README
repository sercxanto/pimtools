pimtools - converting PIM data formats (vcard, ical etc.)

Often an PIM (personal information manager) application claims to be able to
import or export in a standard format. But when you look closer you realize
that it interpret fields in another way as it is defined in the standard, e.g.
the date format is different or another default charset is assumed.

In the last couple of years I had many of such cases where I needed to hack a
script to tweak the exported data of one application so it can be imported into
another one.

In this repository you can find some of these scripts. Note that I have not
extensively tested the code. It "just worked" in this very situation / with
this specific version number. Note also that the output may not be standard
compatible. If all programms would behave like the standard there would be no
need for conversion scripts ...


ical_jpilot_to_egw.py
=====================

Converts the ical output of jpilot to something which can be imported into
eGroupware. The main problem is the different interpretation of recurrent
events.


vcf_jpilot_to_android.py
========================

Converts the VCARD output of jpilot so that it can be imported with the android
contacts app (cynogenmod 6.1.1 for N1). This script was necessary due to the
custom birthday field of jpilot and the declaration of the email address as
telefone number.
